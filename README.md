# Matlab---DC-AC-half-bridge-inverter
MATLAB Simulation of a DC-AC inverter (Converter squares).
The simulation is about the Half-Bridge Inverter.
In the circuit, the number of switches is reduced to 2 by dividing the dc source voltage into two parts with the capacitors. Each capacitor will be the same value and will have voltage Vdc/2 across it.
